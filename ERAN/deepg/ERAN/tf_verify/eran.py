        This constructor takes a reference to a TensorFlow Operation, TensorFlow Tensor, or Keras model. The two TensorFlow functions graph_util.convert_variables_to_constants and 
        graph_util.remove_training_nodes will be applied to the graph to cleanse it of any nodes that are linked to training.
        In the resulting graph there should only be tf.Operations left that have one of the following types [Const, MatMul, Add, BiasAdd, Conv2D, Reshape, MaxPool, Placeholder, Relu, Sigmoid, Tanh]
        If the input should be a Keras model we will ignore operations with type Pack, Shape, StridedSlice, and Prod such that the Flatten layer can be used.
