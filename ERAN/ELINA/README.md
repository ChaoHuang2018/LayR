# ELINA
ETH Library for Numerical Analyis (ELINA) contains optimized implementations of popular numerical abstract domains such as Polyhedra and Octagons for static analysis. 

The library uses improved algorithms, online decomposition as well as state of the art performance optimizations from linear algebra such as vectorization, locality of reference, scalar replacement etc. to significantly improve the performance of static analysis with the numerical domains.
